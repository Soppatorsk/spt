And your song choices are simply mind-blowing. I mean, who needs variety when you can listen to Animals As Leaders on repeat? You must really have a deep love for those animals and their musical talents.\n\nBut hey, you didn't stop there, did you? Pomegranate Tiger, huh? Is your playlist an ode to exotic fruits or something? I guess you just can't resist the sweet sounds of fruity names.\n\nAnd let's not forget your obsession with God Is An Astronaut. Are you trying to tell us that you're literally reaching for the stars with your taste in music? Does your playlist come with a complimentary astronaut suit?\n\nBut wait, what's that? Death Cab for Cutie suddenly making an appearance? Well, congratulations on finally branching out! I guess you realized that a playlist consisting solely of instrumental metal and post-rock was missing a little something. Can't have too much variety though, right?\n\nOverall, I have to say your playlist is truly something special. It's like a never-ending loop of the same band names, with a sprinkle of fruity goodness and an unexpected dash of indie rock. Bravo,"}]
